The instruction format for the third assignment will be:
opcode dest src src
For instructions other than load-store, one or both of the src operands can be immediate.
For load-store, the memory addresss can be immediate.
Instructions are limted to : add, sub, mul, div, and, or, xor, load, store.
Note: There will not be any branches.

Examples:
ADD R1 R2 R3
ADD R1 R2 5
MUL R1 R2 R3
STORE 100 R1 (Store value from R1 at location 100)
STORE R2 R1 (Store value from R1 at the location pointed to be R2)
LOAD R1 100 (Load value from location 100 into R1)
LOAD R1 R2 (Load value into R1 from location pointed to by R2)
